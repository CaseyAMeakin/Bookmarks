This is a simple Django/SQLite3/Bootstrap.js website application to manage URL bookmarks. 

This was an excercise to develop a website from back to front in an afternoon.

It features

* Aesthetically pleasing UI on both desktop and mobile
* Authenticated user account creation and login handling via sessions
* A keyword search feature
* A database model that keeps track of bookmark usage (access information): implemented with SQLite3 and PostgreSQL (can be used interchangably)
* A front end designed using Django template inheritance and Bootstrap.js
* Served via Apache and wsgi mod
