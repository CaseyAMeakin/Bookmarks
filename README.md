This is a simple Django/SQLite3/Bootstrap.js website application to manage URL bookmarks. This was an excercise to develop a website from back to front.

It features

* Authenticated user handling
* Search keyword list associated with each URL bookmarked
* A database model that keeps track of bookmark usage (access information)
* A front end designed using Django template inheritance and Bootstrap.js
